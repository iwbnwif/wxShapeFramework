Changes in version 1.4.0 beta (2007-11-22):
--------------------------------------------
- New (more flexible) version of wxXmlSerializer (saved files are compatible with the previous version).
- Project's directory structure fulfills requirements for integration into wxWidgets/wxAdditions
  distribution (all headers are now located in '../wx/wxsf' and 'wx/wxxmlserializer' subdirs).
- Line shapes connecting child shapes with their parents starts/end at the parent's border, not the center.
- Fixed crash occuring when a parent shape connected with his child shape is removed
- Added "premake" build system

Changes in version 1.3.2 beta (2007-10-26):
--------------------------------------------
- Functions GetAssignedConnections() and GetNeighbours() now allow definition of the connection line type.
- Added function wxSFEditTextShape::EditLabel() which starts label's editation process.
- F2 key now starts the editable shape's label editation mode.
- wxXmlSerializer now allows serialization of its root node properties. Requested behaviour can be set by agrument 'withroot'
  of wxXmlSerializer::SerializeToXml() functions.

Changes in version 1.3.1 beta (2007-09-26):
--------------------------------------------
- Fixed wxSFShapeBase::GetCompleteBoundingBox() function to respect non-zero horizontal
  and verical shape borders.
- Fixed drawing of multiline text shapes during scaling of the whole shape canvas.
- wxSFShapeBase::Update() function is now called recursively for all parents.
- Implemented wxEVT_SF_TEXT_CHANGE event (macro EVT_SF_TEXT_CHANGE). 
- Added wxSFShapeCanvas::OnTextChange() event handler called by the franework if any ediatble text shape
  is changed (default implementation generates the wxEVT_SF_TEXT_CHANGE event).
- Fixed initialization of text shapes after the deserialization if the shape canvas doesn't exist yet.
- Fixed shape resizing problems occured if the shape has one or more children aligned to
  the right or bottom.
- Function wxSFBitmapShape::CreateFromXPM() is now public.
- Partial shape flags (m_fParentChange, m_fSizeChange, m_fPositionChange, m_fAlwaysInside,
  m_fHovering and m_fHighlighting) with relevant accessors have been replaced with 
  one common style property (see STYLE enumeration and wxSFShapeBase::SetStyle(), 
  wxSFShapeBase::GetStyle(), AddStyle(), RemoveStyle(), ContainsStyle() functions). This modification makes
  the wxSF much more flexible and reduces size of the project XML files (only one property (style) is now
  serialized instead of many partial flags).
- Optimized drawing.
- Associated user data now knows its parent shape (via xsSerializable::GetParent() function).
- Unvisible shapes aren't drawn anymore...
- Non-active shapes can't be selected by multiedit control
- Fixed crash during removing of shape whose children are connected via lines with another shapes.
- Code clean-up.

Changes in version 1.3.0 beta (2007-09-07):
--------------------------------------------
- wxSF ported to use wxXmlSerialization (new mini-library suitable for automated serialization/
  deserialization of class objects (arranged into a list or a tree) and their properties 
  (attributes) to/from XML files). The wxXmlSerialization library is shipped together with the wxSF 
  and can be used free and separately in other projects.
- Implemented a container for user-defined data (objects derived from xsSerializable class) which can be
  assigned to the shape and serialized with it (wxSFShapeBase::SetUserData(), wxSFShapeBase::
  GetUserData(), wxSFShapeBase::DeleteUserDataOnDestroy()).
- Implemented wxEVT_SF_LINE_DONE event (macro EVT_SF_LINE_DONE) and related event class 
wxSFShapeEvent.
- Applied compiler symbol WXMAKINGDLL_SF which allows compile the dynamic library with defined 
  WXDLLEXPORT flags.
- Added support for so called 'composed shapes' (for more details see wxSFSample3).
- Added three new sample projects to the library sources distribution.
- Improved C::B and MS Visual Studio project and solution files on Windows.
- Added C::B project files for Linux.
- Fixed shape handles' drawing on Linux.
- Fixed wxSFShapeCanvas::Paste() on Linux.
- Unified look&feel on both Windows and Linux target platforms.
- Succesfully tested with wxWidgets 2.8.4 on Windows XP SP2 (both 32- 
and 64-bit versions), Windows Vista and Linux (Ubuntu 7.04).
- Changed the development status from 'aplha' to 'beta'.
- Several minor bug fixes.

  NOTE: wxSF project file format is not comapatible with previous versions.

Changes in version 1.2.4 alpha (2007-08-10):
--------------------------------------------
- Removed assertion of valid pointer to diagram manager in a shape's destructor.
- Shapes acceptance list in diagram manager is tested for record duplicity

Changes in version 1.2.3 alpha (2007-08-03):
--------------------------------------------
- Fixed function wxSFShapeBase::GetCompleteBoundingBox().
- Fixed update of shapes assigned as children to line shapes (alignment of those
  child shapes is ignored).

Changes in version 1.2.2 alpha (2007-08-02):
--------------------------------------------
- Improved testing of invalid pointers among main framework's components (shape base,
  shape canvas and diagram manager) and thus whole library stability.

Changes in version 1.2.1 alpha (2007-07-30):
--------------------------------------------
- Fixed ability to work with shapes without need of existing shape canvas.

Changes in version 1.2.0 alpha (2007-07-27):
--------------------------------------------
- Separated data and presentation layer (see wxSFDiagramManager and wxSFShapeCanvas classes)
- Updated example code to demonstrate this feature (v1.5)
- Added function wxSFShapeBase::AssignChild()
- Added functions wxSFShapeBase::SetAlwaysInsideParent() and wxSFShapeBase::IsAlwaysInsideParent().
  If the property is set to TRUE then shape's parent is always resized to fit this shape, otherwise
  a size change of child shape doesn't involve parent shape's size.

Changes in version 1.1.6 alpha (2007-07-25):
--------------------------------------------
- Added ability to define shape types accepted by shape canvas instance (functions
  wxSFShapeCanvas::AcceptShape(), wxSFShapeCanvas::IsShapeAccepted(), wxSFShapeCanvas::ClearAcceptedShapes())
- Updated example code to demonstrate this feature (v1.4)
- Fixed wxSFShapeBase::DoAlignment() function

Changes in version 1.1.5 alpha (2007-07-24):
--------------------------------------------
- Fixed function FitToChildren in diamond shape (wxSFDiamondShape)
- Fixed canvas refresh during shape handle dragging
- Added function for alignment of selected shapes in the shape canvas (wxSFShapeCanvas::AlignSelected())
- Updated example code to demonstrate AlignSelected() function

Changes in version 1.1.4 alpha (2007-07-21):
--------------------------------------------
- Various bug fixes, improvements and code clean up
- Function wxSFShapeBase::Scale() can now scale also child shapes

Changes in version 1.1.3 alpha (2007-07-17):
--------------------------------------------
- Added ability to define shape's alignment (child shape can be aligned
inside its parent with given direction and offset)

Changes in version 1.1.2 alpha (2007-07-12):
--------------------------------------------
- Fixed functions wxSFShapeBase::GetNeighbours() and wxSFShapeCanvas::GetNeighbours()

Changes in version 1.1.1 alpha (2007-07-12):
--------------------------------------------
- Added ability to find neighbour shapes (functions wxSFShapeBase::GetNeighbours() and wxSFShapeCanvas::GetNeighbours())

Changes in version 1.1.0 alpha (2007-07-12):
--------------------------------------------
- Enhanced shapes policy (definitions which shape type can be connected to which one, what can be source or what can be target, etc.).
- Ability to get wxSF number from canvas class.
- Several bug fixes.

Changes in version 1.0.0 alpha (2007-07-07):
--------------------------------------------
