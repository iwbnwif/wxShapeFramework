Changes in version 1.2.3 alpha (2007-08-03):
--------------------------------------------
- Fixed function wxSFShapeBase::GetCompleteBoundingBox().
- Fixed update of shapes assigned as children to line shapes (alignment of those
  child shapes is ignored).

Changes in version 1.2.2 alpha (2007-08-02):
--------------------------------------------
- Improved testing of invalid pointers among main framework's components (shape base,
  shape canvas and diagram manager) and thus whole library stability.

Changes in version 1.2.1 alpha (2007-07-30):
--------------------------------------------
- Fixed ability to work with shapes without need of existing shape canvas.

Changes in version 1.2.0 alpha (2007-07-27):
--------------------------------------------
- Separated data and presentation layer (see wxSFDiagramManager and wxSFShapeCanvas classes)
- Updated example code to demonstrate this feature (v1.5)
- Added function wxSFShapeBase::AssignChild()
- Added functions wxSFShapeBase::SetAlwaysInsideParent() and wxSFShapeBase::IsAlwaysInsideParent().
  If the property is set to TRUE then shape's parent is always resized to fit this shape, otherwise
  a size change of child shape doesn't involve parent shape's size.

Changes in version 1.1.6 alpha (2007-07-25):
--------------------------------------------
- Added ability to define shape types accepted by shape canvas instance (functions
  wxSFShapeCanvas::AcceptShape(), wxSFShapeCanvas::IsShapeAccepted(), wxSFShapeCanvas::ClearAcceptedShapes())
- Updated example code to demonstrate this feature (v1.4)
- Fixed wxSFShapeBase::DoAlignment() function

Changes in version 1.1.5 alpha (2007-07-24):
--------------------------------------------
- Fixed function FitToChildren in diamond shape (wxSFDiamondShape)
- Fixed canvas refresh during shape handle dragging
- Added function for alignment of selected shapes in the shape canvas (wxSFShapeCanvas::AlignSelected())
- Updated example code to demonstrate AlignSelected() function

Changes in version 1.1.4 alpha (2007-07-21):
--------------------------------------------
- Various bug fixes, improvements and code clean up
- Function wxSFShapeBase::Scale() can now scale also child shapes

Changes in version 1.1.3 alpha (2007-07-17):
--------------------------------------------
- Added ability to define shape's alignment (child shape can be aligned
inside its parent with given direction and offset)

Changes in version 1.1.2 alpha (2007-07-12):
--------------------------------------------
- Fixed functions wxSFShapeBase::GetNeighbours() and wxSFShapeCanvas::GetNeighbours()

Changes in version 1.1.1 alpha (2007-07-12):
--------------------------------------------
- Added ability to find neighbour shapes (functions wxSFShapeBase::GetNeighbours() and wxSFShapeCanvas::GetNeighbours())

Changes in version 1.1.0 alpha (2007-07-12):
--------------------------------------------
- Enhanced shapes policy (definitions which shape type can be connected to which one, what can be source or what can be target, etc.).
- Ability to get wxSF number from canvas class.
- Several bug fixes.
